# Student Pass Predictor – AI-Powered Predictive System
DSA AI/ML Capstone Project (Education Category)

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a machine learning-based system that predicts whether a student is likely to pass or fail based on academic-related features. The system was developed using Python and deployed as a web application using Flask and Replit.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
How can AI models be developed and deployed in real-world applications to support decision-making and improve task automation through a simple web interface?

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Dataset:** Student Performance Data
- **File used:** `student-mat.csv`
- **Link:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (3.10)
- Google Colab (Model training and analysis)
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- Flask (Web app development)
- Replit (Live deployment)
- HTML/CSS (Frontend UI)

## 🤖 Model Information
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (Supervised Learning)
- **Task Type:** Binary Classification (Pass/Fail)
- **Model File:** `student_pass_predictor.pkl`

- NOTE: As scikit-learn was used, the model is stored in `.pkl` format via `joblib`, not `.h5`.
